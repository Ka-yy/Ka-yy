ðŸ‘‹ Hi I'm Kufre, a software engineer from Abuja, NIgeria.

I'm primarily interested in full-stack development and currently a 2nd year Software engineering major at nile university.

I'm fascinated by large-scale and high-impact products.

Outside of work, I'm interested in following the developments of science. I also play a lot of video games and and make video games on the side.
